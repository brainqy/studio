# For Next.js app, GOOGLE_API_KEY is usually only needed if Genkit is used client-side
# or if Next.js server-side rendering directly calls Google APIs without Genkit.
# For Genkit flows, the GOOGLE_API_KEY is typically read by the Genkit process.
# For this example, we assume Genkit flows are server-side and handled by the Next.js server environment.
# If your Genkit needs a key accessible by the browser (unlikely and not recommended), prefix with NEXT_PUBLIC_
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_dev_google_api_key_for_genkit_if_needed_by_server

# JWT_SECRET is a backend secret and should NOT be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_
# It would be used by your Spring Boot backend.
# This line is a reminder for your Spring Boot .env or application.properties.
